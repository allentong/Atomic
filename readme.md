## Atomic Elements Selector Engine

### Description

Atomic encapsulates and augments a browser's native querySelectorAll function.

Note: Atomic is complete, but is still in 'beta' and is subject to issues/changes.

### Features

* Adds some selector shortcuts, and some functionality that querySelectorAll couldn't normally handle
* A fallback function can be assigned, for when querySelectorAll fails or isn't available
* Selector results can be returned in selector order, instead of DOM order
* Selector results are cached whenever possible, with options to clear the cache or to not cache at all
* Provides a simple DOM ready event handler
* Selector results are returned as an Array
